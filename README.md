# Fashion Finder App üëîüõçÔ∏èüëú

## Introduction

Have you ever browsed through photo-sharing sites like Instagram or Pinterest, spotted an outfit you loved, but had no idea where to find the clothing? This project will guide you through building an application that allows you to upload a photo of any outfit or type in a text description, and then suggests similar apparel pieces to help you recreate the look.

## Overview

In this project, you'll learn how to leverage Google Vertex AI, Weaviate vector database, Google‚Äôs multimodal embeddings, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Weaviate‚Äôs hybrid search feature. By combining these tools, you'll perform vector similarity searches and build a sophisticated multi-modal Recommender System.

## Key Concepts

### Vector Search
Vector search is a method of finding similar items in a dataset by comparing vectors. Each item is represented as a vector in a high-dimensional space, and similarity is determined by the distance between these vectors. This technique is especially useful for tasks involving images and text, where traditional keyword search methods are inadequate.

### Embeddings
Embeddings are dense vector representations of data. In this project, embeddings are used to represent images and text descriptions of fashion items in a shared vector space, allowing for efficient similarity comparisons.

### Multimodal Recommender System
A multimodal recommender system leverages multiple types of data (e.g., images and text) to provide recommendations. In this project, both image embeddings and text embeddings are used to find and suggest similar fashion items.

### Hybrid Search
Hybrid search combines multiple search strategies to improve the accuracy and relevance of search results. In this project, both vector similarity and keyword-based search are used to enhance the recommendation system's performance.

## Running the Application

Follow the steps in the provided Jupyter notebooks to set up and run the application:

- **Part 1**: [Fashion_Finder_Part_1.ipynb](Fashion_Finder_Part_1.ipynb)
- **Part 2**: [Fashion_Finder_Part_2.ipynb](Fashion_Finder_Part_2.ipynb)

These notebooks contain detailed instructions and code snippets to help you build and run the Fashion Finder application.

### Files Included
- `mm_rag.py`: Core application file for the recommender system.
- `Logo.png`: Logo for the application.

### Deployment
Instructions for deploying the application using Streamlit and Pyngrok are provided in the tutorial notebooks.
